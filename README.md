# kEvol

kEvol is a multi-program family that has implemented EA algorithms.

## Description


kEvol is a multi-program family that has been written in Python. You can use this family, whether as a single set of programs or as modules imported in other programs.  kEvol allows to define all the possible values of the EA algorithm's parameters and create all possible different 
combinations of the parameters that are known as the configurations. There is also a command line-based reporter
that allows users to load the EA algorithm report(s) and query different information and plot them.
